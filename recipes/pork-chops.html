    <h2>What Makes These The World's Best Pork Chops?</h2>
        <p>There might not be an actual award given to pork chops, but if there was, this 5-ingredient dish would surely win it thanks to the sauce alone. Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill.</p>
        <p>In fact, many reviewers suggest marinating the pork chops in the glaze first, brushing them with more glaze on the grill, and making an extra batch of sauce to serve on the side for dipping because it's just that good.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Grill Pork Chops</h2>
        <p>When the weather is nice, take your pork chops outside and throw them on the grill. Not only will they cook up quickly, but they'll also get the tasty grill marks that everyone loves.</p>
        <p>Grilling pork chops is incredibly simple, all you have to do is preheat your grill to medium heat and oil the grate. Then lightly brush the glaze over the chops and sear them on both sides until they are no longer pink in the middle.</p>
    
    <h2>How Long to Grill Pork Chops</h2>
        <p>You'll want to grill your pork chops until they are no longer pink in the middle and reach an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). The National Pork Board recommends about eight to 12 minutes for pork chops that are ¾-inch thick. However, every grill is different so it may take some grills longer while some may cook faster.</p>
    
    <h2>What is the Best Cut of Pork to Use For Pork Chops?</h2>
        <p>In this recipe, you can use either boneless or bone-in pork chops. They typically take about the same amount of time to cook, so it's really up to personal preference or what's on sale at the grocery store this week.</p>
        <p>You will want to pay attention to the thickness of the pork chop, though. Thicker pork chops will take longer to cook, but they won't dry out as easily as thinner pork chops can on the grill. So, thicker pork chops are usually recommended for grilling.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
